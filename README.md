# My own App using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, start the express.js server `node express.js` and run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application consists of three tabs: Pizza list, Ingredients list and operations list. <br>
The data is fetched from MongoDB. Pressing a specific element retrieves additional information from the database for a given pizza, ingredient or operation.
