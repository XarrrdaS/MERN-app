# App using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js
To make the application work correctly, install 'node_modules' via `npm install` first.<br>
Then, start the `server.js` express server `node server.js` and run the react app `npm start`.<br>
The application consists of three tabs: Pizza list, Ingredients list and operations list. <br>
The data is fetched from MongoDB. Pressing a specific element retrieves additional information from the database for a given pizza, ingredient or operation.<br><br>
Additionally, I added a `database structure` folder consisting of JSON files from MongoDB.

This is how the tabs looks like.<br><br>

Here you can see the references between the data. Each tab contains references to data, depending on the tab and item selected.
